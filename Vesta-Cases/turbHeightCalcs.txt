There is a slight slope to the roof, rises from 14.326m to 15.608m over a distance of 123.165m. 
This is a slope of 0.01041 m/m
This document is to determine where the turbines are approximately located in order to keep the swept area of the turbine at a consistent height
Turb is 2.217m above highest roof point (with 1.5m turbine. Leave room for spoiler)

Turb loc:
For 5m away from edge (highest edge 17m away):
	Highest roof point (determines spoiler/turbine loc) - 14.503m
	Turb height - 16.720m

For 55.5m away (highest edge 67.5m away):
	Highest roof point - 15.029m
	Turb height - 17.246m

For 105m away (highest edge 117m away): 
	Highest roof point - 15.544m
	Turb height - 17.761m
