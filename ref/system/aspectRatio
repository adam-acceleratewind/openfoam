// IMPORTANT!! The spoiler has to be modified to fit the building size, preferably with 3m of buffer to each side
//In the spoilers folder, a 7m, 12m, 13.5m, 20m, 26m, and 33m spoiler stl are included. The file must be put into
//the constant folder and named "spoiler.stl" and it must be centered at 0,0,0 in the proper orientation
//Also important: the 0.orig files are specifically set up to have a uniform inlet velocity between all cases. However,
//because the top of the building is always set at y = 0, the inlet U function must be changed to account for it.
//This is explained more in the 0.orig/U file

//Change these based on desired aspect ratios
length	1;
height	1;
width	1;

//Modifiable scaling factor (in meters). Change if want smaller/larger domain. Change 0.orig/U file accordingly (see above)
//13 meters was chosen because an aspect ratio of 1, 2, and 2.5 are ~40ft, ~80ft, and ~100ft respectively
