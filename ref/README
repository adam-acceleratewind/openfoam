This is a reference folder for the Aspect Ratio tests that were ran. This was the code that was used in all of the tests ran and is easily modifiable for new cases. 
  Each file is well commented and serves as a baseline that should work for whatever aspect ratio is desired.

In order to change the code for a desired case, you need to do the following tasks:
  * Open the "aspectRatio" file located in the system folder. This includes instructions (reiterated here), as well as the location where the aspect ratio of the building and the characteristic length of the building are modified. It currently is set to an aspect ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 and a characteristic length of 13m. These were chosen to most closely correspond with common building dimensions of ~40ft, 80ft, and 100ft but can be changed. These aspect ratio values should only be changed to increments of .5 as the code could cause issues if they are more complex fractions.  
  * If you are modifying the aspect ratio value of the width of the building from 1, or wish to modify the spoiler length, a new spoiler.stl file is needed. With the current characteristics of a 1 width and a 13m characteristic length, the 7m spoiler is used in order to give 3 meters of buffer space from the spoiler edge to the building edge. Within this folder is included a "spoilers" folder, which includes a 7m, 13.5m, 20m, and 33m length spoiler, which correspond to the spoilers used for a 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 width buildings at this characteristic length with the aforementioned buffer space from the building edge. The desired spoiler should be placed in the constant/triSurface folder and it MUST be renamed to spoiler.stl. I recommend renaming the note file in the triSurface folder to allow the spoiler length to still be known.
    - If a spoiler that is a different size is desired, it can be created using the Spoiler file in the AccelerateWind Onshape. The Spoiler file is located in the Ike folder. To change the length, edit the Extrude 1 to the desired length, then edit the Transform 4 (Z Translation) to be = length/2. This will center the spoiler in the correct orientation. Export the spoiler as a .stl on a fine resolution.
  * If you are modifying the aspect ratio value of the height of the building from 1, or otherwise modify the height of the building, the 0.orig/U file MUST be edited in order to update the inlet velocity. More detailed instructions are within the 0.orig/U file, but basically the inlet velocity profile needs to be shifted with the new building location, and this is done by modifying the y_diff variable in the inlet condition.

Potential Problems/Improvements in Modification:
  * If the aspect ratios are pushed to significantly higher values (i.e. > 5 or 6), the domain might become unreasonably large for the case (above the maxGlobalCells of 35mil). In this case, I advise that the number of cells in blockMesh is reduced uniformly by /2 (so that the multipliers in the number of cell values become .25) and then the snappyHexMesh region refinements are all increased by 1. It might also be helpful to increase the domain sizing of the outer box refinement. This should preserve similar mesh sizing around the building while not having a high refinement level very far from the building that unnecessarily drives up cell count.
  * If aspect ratios that aren't just in increments of .5 are desired, a couple of lines could be included within the blockMesh code to round the number of cells calculation to the nearest whole number.
  * The roughness length of .017 is fairly smooth and likely yield results that would differ from reality. This could be increased if desired, but would mean that the case couldn't be compared to previous cases.
  * I'm sure many more, but this should serve as a good baseline for running a rough model of any general building shape.
